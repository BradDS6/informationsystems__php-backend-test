composer update
php artisan key:generate

composer require laravel/ui AND composer update //needed to get php artisan ui:auth
npm install
npm run dev (x2)
DB_HOST=localhost

Now from Docker OR in command after running Makefile shell
php artisan migrate (x2) //NOW backend-test shows tables jobs and delivered_revenues
